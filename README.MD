Some of my solvings of problems from codingame.com

# Typescript

## [The Labyrinth](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-labyrinth)

_Algos: BFS_

That's the simulation of the original puzzle. The goal is to find the Control room and then return to the start point using the shortiest path.

You can draw your own maze shape using imagination or asking ChatGPT.

**Look at _ingameide.txt_ for the solution you can copy-paste into the game's IDE.**

### Run
